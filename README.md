# Decred Marketing Strategy - notes

Thoughts for Podcast with DCR in Depth

## Content creation and distribution strategy

**Important**: If we don't want to pay ads to distrute content to eyeballs, we have to do the work by interacting with it!

- video creation takes 80% energy, but only 20% of spent energy creates value
- 20% of energy invested into distribution to different channels will create 80% value
- Said differently: Content is the King, distribution is the Queen (from GaryV?) and people interacting are the White Knights ♞ fighting for the Kingdom (Decred)

- Imagine having a company and not sharing or liking its products or services with friends! Or not asking your friends to leave Google Review if they liked the service/product!

### Example: 1x Exitus's video

Majority (80%) of the effort is to create the content. But if we leave it only on Youtube, and we don't like+comment every single video, we are leaving money on the table.

What to do:

- upload the video to multiple video portals
- extract audio; publish to multiple podcast portals
- transcript is already done by Exitus; publish it on Medium; Publish0x; extract important points -> create a Tweetstorm; repurpose the Tweetstorm and publish it on Quora in form of answers. Every month we can create a Question "What happened in Decred in Aug 2020?"

### Example: Decred in Depth podcast

- re-code to video, add one static image and publish it on Youtube (and other portals)
- transcribe most important points and create a Tweetstorm
- use this tweetstorm and re-publish it on Medium and publish0x platforms
- repurpose the tweetstorm and use it for Quora

#### Medium

- 45-50 claps on **every article** from important accounts [required]; comment [optional]
- do understand that only content which is read and liked is being pushed to more eyeballs; simple as that
- follow key accounts -> official Decred accounts, Checkmate, PermabullNino, ..
- For content transcribed from podcasts or videos -> Always include first paragraph -> Decred's pitch! Think about new viewers who don't know Decred yet.

#### Reddit

- We need to post also positive messages; People did DM me positively about withDecred.org launch, but nobody wrote it also publicly. Then when new people are lurking around, they only see trolls and negative feelings.
- To put this in context: Imagine you have a restaurant business. Half of the people come to the chef to thank him for the great food, but nobody leaves a Google Maps review. Only trolls or unhappy people. Then when you are searching for restaurant on Google Maps, you won't go this place, because you **mostly see negative reviews and 2 stars ratings**!
- We need to start reporting trolls on Reddit (there is a function to do that!) and start blocking them more promptly. I am all for open communication, but there are accounts who just seek to damage Decred. Reddit moderators know about these accounts. Let's put a stop to it!

#### Matrix

- Hard to understand people's feelings because you don't know people when you join, they don't use emojis; it's hard to tell who is being sarcastic or
- There are no "Rules" which new person can read. Let's not slash newcomers.
- If we don't want newcomers on Matrix, let's channel them to Discord and Telegram

### Marketing thoughts

#### How to create content

- Put Decred into perspective - compare DAO size, compare governance model, compare how much of tx are being mixed, compare DEX. (Many) People don't derive own conclusions, they consume what you show them.
- Potential monthly content: compare developer activity with other projects. There is account on Twitter that does all the stats, we just need to create article/podcast/tweetstorm/reddit post with these stats
-

### New platforms

- I don't know all platforms!
- How we can raise interest By Millenials/GenZ? Eg. we can write "Investment thesis for Millenials/GenZ". I already have some ideas, feel free to reach out to me! (@pavel)
- Who can reach out to micro-influencers on TikTok / Snapchat? Look at what they did with Doge
-

### Don't be a maximalist!

- I don't even pay attention to accounts on Twitter who post "Nobody understands.", "Few..", "$LINK to the moon", "$XRP to the moon", etc.
- Do NOT act like these people.
- Look what people are interested in and "connect with them" through these topics. When they ask you, then talk about Decred.
- DM people on Twitter or Reddit if you like what they are saying. Connect with them on one-to-one level
- Listen to this podcast with community leaders from Australia -> it's exactly how they grow community in Australia

### Website: withDecred.org

- Created with several goals in mind:

  - Content for newcomers to learn about Decred and have easy "buy here" button
  - Easy to replicate growth model: I read about Decred on withDecred website. Then I bought, then I learned more. How I can explain Decred to my friends? Raise their interest and send them to website! They can/will repeat this process. We don't need to make people "experts in Decred", let them replicate this simple process!
  - We can track user behaviour .. we can based next decisions based on **objective data**

- Watch out for https://withDecred.org/win
  - button create ticket
  - loading indicator -> show pitch!
  - QR code + pitch

#### Next possible steps

- Repurpose individual articles into Tweetstorms - they are easier to consume
- Repurpose articles and publish on publish0x platform
- Create podcast -> read those articles (1 podcast - 1 article)
- Build relationships with good people and later ask them to share @withDecred (eg. @notsofast, @cburniske, @MustStopMurad, ..)

## People's objections

So what's stopping you from doing metioned metioned activities?

**Objection**: I don't want to register on Medium/Reddit/Twitter/publish0x, because I don't want to compromise my identity!

- **Solution**: Create a new free email on Protonmail.com (or any other platform) and use this account for this this purpose.

**Objection**: I don't have time to do this or I don't remember to do it consistently.

- **Solution**: Create a habit: every time you open Decrediton or Matrix, go and upvote/like all content that's new! (People spent incredible amount of time on social media or watching Nextflix; just nobody realizes it)

**Objection**: I don't want to support mentioned platforms!

- **Solution**: You are not supporting them. You are supporting Decred!

#### Notes

There is opportunity to participate in the conversation and answer crypto-related and Decred related questions to grow awareness of Decred and its strengths.

I was personally writing content on Quora in cryptocurrencies* topics and I was able to get to Top10 writers for several topics. Achieving such result helped get exposure to topics I wanted to write about and measurable traffic results were achieved (to goal was to generate traffic to a particular website).

My answers were also send in email digest to dozens of thousands of people, I think in summary my answers were sent to around 150,000 people via email (over a period of 3 months).

I already described on Reddit, how such results can be achieved

[https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/it0idm/decred_on_quora/g5gince/](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/it0idm/decred_on_quora/g5gince/)

Since this activity is reproducible, we can sponsor a good content writer who can invest his time to create valuable content on Quora and generate more awareness for Decred.

There are measurable results:

- User see view statistics of his answers
- Website traffic increase can be measured
- Discord and Telegram user growth is already being measured
